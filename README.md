# O Notation and Time Complexity

What is "Big O notation" and "time complexity"?

Code examples demonstrating the following complexity classes:
* *O(1)* - constant time (inserting elements at the beginning of a linked list)
* *O(n)* - linear time (summing up all elements of an array)
* *O(n²)* - quadratic time (sorting an array with Insertion Sort)
* *O(log n)* - logarithmic time (finding an element within a sorted array using binary search)
* *O(n log n)* - quasi-linear time (sorting an array with Quicksort)
